<H2> Abstract</H2>
TtH translates TeX source that uses the Plain macro package, or
LaTeX, into a near equivalent in HTML.  It is extremely fast and
completely portable. It produces web documents that are more compact
and managable, and faster-viewing, than those from other converters,
because it really translates the equations, instead of converting them
into images.

Almost all of TeX's mathematics is supported with the exception of a
few obscure symbols that are absent from the fonts normally available
to browsers. Support includes, for example, in-line equations with
subscripts and superscripts, display equations with built-up
fractions, over accents, large delimiters, operators with limits;
matrix, pmatrix, cases, [but not bordermatrix]; over/underbrace [but
using a rule, not a brace].

 A few non-standard TeX commands are supported as follows
<a href="#tthFtNtAAD" name="tthFrefAAD"><sup>3</sup></a>. See
also <A href="#epsf">6.3</A>.<a NAME="HTML+insertion13">
</a>
 
<pre>
\epsfbox{file.[e]ps} Puts in an anchor called "Figure" linked to 
    file.[e]ps (default), or alternatively calls user-supplied script 
    to convert the [e]ps file to a gif image and optionally inline it.  
\special{html:"tags"} inserts ``tags'' into the HTML e.g. for images etc.  
\href{reference}{anchor} highlights ``anchor'' with href=``reference''.
\url{URL} like \href but with URL providing both reference and anchor.
\begin{[raw]html} ... \end{[raw]html} environment passed direct to output.
\tthdump{...} The group is omitted by TtH. Define \tthdump as a nop for TeX.

1.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsupported Commands</H3>

<p>
 When TtH encounters TeX constructs that it cannot handle either
because there is no HTML equivalent, or because it is not clever
enough, it tries to remove the mess they would otherwise cause in the
HTML code, generally giving a warning of the action if it is not sure
what it is doing. <a NAME="commands+unsupported14">
</a>The following are
examples of constructs not translated.

<p>

<pre>
 \magnification \magstep etc : Removes the whole construct.
 Any dimension and glue commands: removed.
 Boxes: usually ignored (but this can sometimes cause problems).

<p>
<a NAME="flex20">
</a><a NAME="compile20">
</a>The source for TtH is flex code which is processed to produce a C program
tth.c which comprises the distribution. This file is compiled by

<pre>
	gcc -o tth tth.c

or whatever C compiler you are using. Compilation takes a couple of
minutes on a fast 486.  Alternatively, you may be able to obtain a
precompiled executable from wherever you accessed this file.

<p>
The executable should then be copied to whatever directory you want
(preferably on your path of course). That's all!

TtH is extremely fast in default mode on any reasonable hardware.
Conversion of even large TeX files should be a matter of a second or

</a>

<p>
Messages about T<sub>T</sub>H's state and its assessment of the T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;it is
translating are output always to the <tt>stderr</tt> stream, which
normally displays on the console, but under Un*x type systems can be
redirected to a file if necessary. Normally these messages are one of
three types:

<p>

<H4>Error Messages</H4> 
These start <tt>**** Error:</tt> and indicate some improper condition or
error either in T<sub>T</sub>H&nbsp;or in the T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;of the file being
translated. Some errors are fatal and cause T<sub>T</sub>H&nbsp;to stop. On others
it will continue, but the T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;file probably should be corrected in
order to get correct output.

<p>

<H4>Warnings</H4>
These start <tt>****</tt> but without reporting <tt>Error</tt>. They are
messages by which T<sub>T</sub>H&nbsp;indicates aspects of the translation process
that may not be fully satisfactory, usually because of known limitations,
but which quite likely will not prevent the translated file from
displaying correctly, and so do not <em>necessarily</em> require
intervention. Examples include the use of dimensions, glue, or similar
T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;commands that have no HTML equivalent. 

<p>

<H4>Informational and external</H4>
Lines with no <tt>****</tt> are either informational, meaning the state
of the translation is not considered abnormal, or else they may come
from external programs (e.g. makeindex), over which T<sub>T</sub>H&nbsp;has no
control.

<p>
The switch <tt>-v</tt> causes more verbose messages to be output, which
may be helpful for understanding why errors are reported. A higher
level of verbosity <tt>-V</tt> can be invoked, but is intended primarily
for internal debugging of T<sub>T</sub>H&nbsp;and will rarely be comprehensible!

<p>
The presumption that lies behind T<sub>T</sub>H&nbsp;message design is that the file
being translated has been debugged using T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;or L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;to remove
syntax errors. T<sub>T</sub>H&nbsp;is not good at understanding or reporting T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;syntax errors and does not keep an exact count of line numbers
(especially when <tt>\input</tt> is used). Therefore error reporting by
T<sub>T</sub>H&nbsp;does not reach even the low standard of clarity set by T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;and
L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;error messages. Although T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;files <em>can</em> be debugged using
T<sub>T</sub>H&nbsp;alone, since it is very fast, the process is not recommended for
inexpert T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;users. Moreover, since T<sub>T</sub>H&nbsp;understands both T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;and
L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;simultaneously, it can parse some files that T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;or L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;
separately cannot.

5.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Equations</H3>

<p>
<a NAME="HTML+3.251">
</a><a NAME="HTML+4.051">
</a><a NAME="font+face51">
</a> Equations are translated internally into HTML3.2 as much as it
allows. TtH uses HTML3.2 tables for layout of built-up fractions in
display equations. It also uses the extension HTML tag  &lt; font
face=``symbol'' &gt; , supported by Netscape and other major browsers (and
part of the HTML4.0 specification) to render Greek and large
delimiters etc. Untranslatable TeX math tokens are inserted verbatim.

<p>
<a NAME="LaTeX2HTML+differences51">
</a>The internal approach to equation translation is a major area where
TtH departs from the philosophy of Latex2html and its derivatives. TtH
does not use any images to try to represent hard-to-translate
constructs like equations.  Instead it uses the native ability of HTML
to the fullest in providing a semantically correct rendering of the
equation. The aesthetic qualities obtained are in practice no worse on
average than Latex2html's inlined images, which are generally slightly
misaligned and of uncertain scaling relative to the text. Some
limitations in the HTML code are inevitable, of course, but one ends
up with a compact representation that can be rendered directly by the
browser without the visitor having to download any additional helper
code (e.g. Java equation renderer).

<p>
<a NAME="italic+equation style51">
</a>TtH offers an <b>option [-i]</b> which <b>makes italic the default</b>
font within equations, and thus the style more TeX-like. The italic
font appearance in browsers is not as satisfactory as TeX's math
italic, so for many documents roman looks better.

<p>
<a NAME="spacing51">
</a><b>Spacing</b> in equations is handled slightly differently by TtH than
by TeX. The reason is that most browsers use fonts that will crowd the
characters horizontally too close for comfort in many cases (for
example: M<sub><font face=symbol>||</font
></sub>/2). Also, built-up HTML equations are more
spread out vertically than in TeX. Therefore TtH equations look better
if spaces are added between some characters. So TtH <em>
does not</em> remove spaces in the original TeX file between characters in
equations. The author is thus able to control this detail of layout in
the HTML without messing up their TeX file - since TeX will ignore
any spaces inserted. Legacy TeX code that contains a lot of spurious
whitespace (ignored by TeX) may, as a result, occasionally become too
spread-out when translated.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc5.2">
5.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;In-line Equation Limitations</H3>

<p>
<a NAME="limitations52">
</a><a NAME="in-line equations+arrays52">
</a><a NAME="in-line equations+fractions52">
</a><a NAME="in-line equations+overaccents52">
</a>Some TeX capabilities are extremely difficult or impossible to
translate into HTML, because of browser limitations, and are best
avoided if possible. Arrays or matrices in <b>in-line equations</b>
cannot be properly supported because tables cannot be placed in-line
in HTML<a href="#tthFtNtAAE" name="tthFrefAAE"><sup>4</sup></a>. TtH output will be
strangely disjointed. Likewise built-up fractions, most over- and
under-accents, and indeed anything that requires specific placement on
the page other than simple subscript or superscript and underline,
cannot be rendered <em>in-line</em> in HTML, although TtH will render
them well in <em>displaystyle</em>. These latter constructs are
nevertheless commonly used in in-line TeX. TtH adopts the default
policy of indicating in an unambiguous and relatively intuitive way
what construct is being used (as opposed to simply omitting it). For
example <tt>$\hat{a}$</tt> is rendered [^a]. The result is rarely
elegant. Therefore in authoring TeX that is known to be destined for
HTML translation, one should bear in mind these limitations, and use
an appropriate style.

<p>
<A NAME="inline">
</A><a NAME="in-line equations+built-up display52">
</a> As an option, TtH provides switch <tt>-t</tt> to convert inline
equations that use built-up constructs into a sort of half display,
half in-line equation. Each time a new in-line equation is encountered
[<tt>$ ... $</tt> or <tt>\( ... \)</tt>] that needs to be built up, an
HTML table that starts a new line is begun, and the text then flows on
afterwards. For example
<br><table Border=0 align=left><tr><td nowrap></td><td nowrap align="center">1<hr NOSHADE>2 + n<br></td><td nowrap align="center"></td></table><br>
This option gives a slightly disjointed layout for simple equations
but is a big improvement for some situations, e.g. in-line matrices.

<A NAME="Latexfiles">
</A>
<a NAME="LaTeX2HTML+differences61">
</a><a NAME="portability61">
</a>
A major difference between TtH and LaTeX2HTML is that TtH does
not call the latex or tex programs at all, and is not specifically
dependent upon these, or indeed any other (e.g. PERL), programs being
installed on the translating system. Its portability is therefore
virtually universal.

<p>
<a NAME="auxiliary files61">
</a><a NAME="switches+-L61">
</a>Forward references in LaTeX are handled by multiple passes that write
auxiliary files. TtH does only a single pass through the source.  If
you want TtH to use LaTeX constructs (e.g. tableofcontents,
bibliographic commands, etc.) that depend on auxiliary files, then
you <em>do</em> need to run LaTeX on the code so that these files are
generated. You must also tell TtH, using the switch -Lfilename, the
base file name of these auxiliary files (which is the name of the
original file omitting the extension). If TtH cannot find the relevant
auxiliary file because you didn't run LaTeX and generate the files or
didn't include the switch, then it will omit the construct and warn
you.<a NAME="references+forward61">
</a>
 Forward references via ref will not work if the .aux file is
unavailable, but backward references will. The -L switch with no
filename may be used to tell TtH that the document being translated is
to be interpreted as a LaTeX file even though it lacks the usual LaTeX
header commands. This may be useful for translating single equations
that (unwisely) use the <tt>\frac</tt> command.

<p>
If you routinely use LaTeX in a way that requires auxiliary files and grow
tired of always having to specify the -L switch to TtH, a simple ``l2h''
script may be useful. For example under Linux (Un*x) a script such as

<pre>
tth &lt;$1.tex &#62;$1.html -L$1 
</pre>or the equivalent batch file under DOS/Wind*ws, may save some typing.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc6.2">
6.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Indexing</H3>
<a NAME="indexing62">
</a>
Indexing an HTML document is different from indexing a printed
document, because a printed index refers to page numbers, which have
no meaning in HTML because there are no page breaks. TtH indexes LaTeX
documents <em>by section number</em> rather than by page; assuming, of
course, that they have been prepared with index entries in the
standard LaTeX fashion.

<p>
<a NAME="makeindex62">
</a>When processing a LaTeX file that contains the <tt>\makeindex</tt>
command in its preamble, TtH will construct an appropriately
cross-hyperlinked index that will be input when the command
<tt>\printindex</tt> is encountered, which <em>must be after</em> all the index
references <tt>\index{ ... }</tt> in the document. TtH does this
independently of LaTeX, but not of the subsidiary program
<tt>makeindex</tt> that is normally used with LaTeX to produce the final
index ``file.ind''. TtH creates its index entries in a file with
extension .tid (Tth InDex).  Because of <tt>makeindex</tt> program
limitations, TtH currently removes all the page-number formatting that
is present in the index entry (but not the reference formatting). It
also uses the section reference style ``1-2'', separated by a dash,
because this is the standard form that <tt>makeindex</tt> expects and it
is cumbersome to change it. The actual reference is less important to
the reader than the fact that TtH inserts a link to the actual place
in the document indexed.  When the <tt>\printindex</tt> command is
encountered, TtH closes this file and runs makeindex on it, which
creates by default a file with extension .ind, and then TtH reads the
.ind file in as its index.  Because the .ind file that TtH produces
may well be incompatible with running LaTeX itself on the file, TtH
deletes the .ind file that it creates (and hence one is left without
such a file at the end). If, instead of creating an index file during
TtH processing, one wants to use with TtH an index file already
created, all that is needed is to <em>remove</em> the <tt>\makeindex</tt>
command from the top of the latex source. Any existing .ind file will
still be input by
<tt>\printindex</tt> but no indexing files will be written or deleted.

<p>
 <em>If you run TtH on a file that contains both a <tt>\makeindex</tt>
command and a <tt>\printindex</tt> it will overwrite your file.ind</em>.  In
the unusual situation where your index, file.ind, was created
laboriously by hand and cannot be recreated, you should be very
careful to remove the
<tt>\makeindex</tt> command from the .tex file. For safety, of course, 
also save a copy of your file.ind somewhere else.

<p>
The <tt>\makeindex</tt> command, if present, will also cause TtH to add
<a NAME="Table of Contents+Index entry62">
</a>
a linked entry called ``Index'' 
to the end of any table of contents. This entry is a highly desirable
feature for an HTML file, but if there is no <tt>\printindex</tt>
command at the end of the document, the index will not exist, so the
reference will be non-existent.

<p>
On some operating systems with file name length restrictions, the
makeindex program is called makeindx. Therefore a TtH switch is
provided: <tt>-xcommandline</tt>, which substitutes <tt>commandline</tt>
for the default call <tt>makeindex</tt>. Therefore, <tt>-xmakeindx</tt>
will switch to the correct program name on one of these limited
operating systems. This switch also allows additional parameters or
switches to be passed to makeindex via e.g.&nbsp;
<tt>-x"makeindex -s style.sty"</tt>.
If you don't have the makeindex program, you can't create indexes with
TtH or LaTeX, except by hand.

<p>
All of the index file processing naturally requires that TtH have
write permission for the directory in which the original latex file
(specified by the -L switch) resides.

6.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Graphics Inclusion: epsfbox/includegraphics</H3>
<A NAME="epsf">
</A>
<a NAME="graphics files63">
</a>
The standard way in plain TeX to include a graphic is using the epsf
macros. The work is done by \epsfbox{file.[e]ps} which
TtH can parse. By default TtH produces a simple link to such a
postscript file, or indeed any format file.

<p>
<a NAME="ps2gif63">
</a>Optionally TtH can use a more appropriate graphics format, possibly
using a user-supplied (script or) program called <tt>ps2gif</tt> to convert the
postscript file to a gif file, ``file.gif''. [``file'' is the name of
the original postscript file without the extension]. When the switch -e1 or -e2
is specified, if ``file.gif'' or ``file.jpg'' already exists in
the same directory as implied by the reference to ``file.ps'' then no
conversion is done and the file found is used instead.  That gif (or
jpg) is then automatically either linked (-e1) or inlined (-e2) in the
document. If no gif or jpg is found, <tt>ps2gif</tt> is called.  A linux (un*x)
<tt>ps2gif</tt> script using Ghostscript and the pbmplus utilities for this
purpose is included with the distribution.  A comparable batch program
can be constructed to work under other operating systems
<a href="#tthFtNtAAF" name="tthFrefAAF"><sup>5</sup></a>  or else the conversion can be
done by hand. Naturally you need these utility programs or their
equivalent on your system to do the conversion.  The calling
command-line for whatever <tt>ps2gif</tt> is supplied must be of the
form:

<pre>ps2gif inputfile.ext outputfile.ext</pre>
 The program must
have permission to write the outputfile (file.gif) in the directory in
which the file.ps resides. 

<p>
<a NAME="icons63">
</a>By popular request, a third graphics option -e3 for generating icons is
now available. If no ``file.gif'' exists, TtH passes to <tt>ps2gif</tt> a third
argument consisting of the name, ``file_icon.gif'', of an icon file.
<tt>ps2gif</tt> is expected to create it from the same postscript file. In
other words the call becomes

<pre>ps2gif file.eps file.gif file_icon.gif</pre>
 This third argument is then the file that is
inlined, while the larger gif file named ``file.gif'' is linked such
that clicking on the icon displays the full-size gif file. The icon
will not be created if ``file.gif'' already exists, because
<tt>ps2gif</tt> will not then be called.

<p>
<a NAME="includegraphics63">
</a>The LaTeX2e command \includegraphics{...} and the older
\[e]psfig{file=...} are treated the same as \epsfbox.
Their optional arguments are ignored.

<p>
<a NAME="postscript63">
</a><a NAME="jpeg63">
</a><a NAME="gif63">
</a>If the extension is omitted for the graphics file specification, then
.ps or .eps is tried.  If the extension of the file specified is
non-null and not .ps or .eps, no conversion is done but the file
is referenced or in-lined as an image. In effect, then, TtH supports
postscript, encapsulated postscript, gif, and jpeg, plus any future
formats that become supported by common browsers. However, LaTeX does
not support these other formats, so it will give an error message if
it can't find a postscript file, unless you specify the bounding box,
thus preventing LaTeX interrogating the file.

<a NAME="picture environment64">

The picture environment cannot be translated to HTML. Pictures using
the built-in LaTeX commands must be converted to a graphics file such
as a gif, and then included using <tt>\includegraphics</tt>, see
<A href="#epsf">6.3</A>. The switch <tt>-a</tt>, causes TtH to attempt automatic 
picture conversion using a user-supplied routine <tt>latex2gif</tt>.
When this switch is used, TtH outputs the picture to a file pic<i>n</i>.tex,
where  <i>n</i> is the number of the picture (if there does not already exist
a file pic<i>n</i>.gif). It then calls the command <tt>latex2gif picn</tt>
which must be a command (e.g. a script using latex, dvips, etc.) on
the system, which converts the file pic<i>n</i>.tex to a file pic<i>n</i>.gif. An
example linux script is included in the distribution but this
conversion script is dependent on the system and so is entirely the
user's responsibility. For viewing the results, the files pic<i>n</i>.gif
must be accessible to the browser in the same directory as the HTML
files, then they will be included in-line. It is impossible for a
picture environment to be converted in this automatic fashion if it
contains macros defined somewhere else in the original LaTeX file,
because the macros will then be undefined in the picture file that is
extracted, and LaTeX will be stumped. In that case, manual
intervention is necessary.

<A NAME="tabhal">

The tabular environment is the recommended way to construct tables in
LaTeX. In plain TeX, although <tt>\settabs</tt> etc.&nbsp;is supported, the
<tt>\halign{ ... }</tt> command is recommended.  (The LaTeX tabbing
environment is <em>not supported</em> by TtH because it is antithetical
to the spirit of HTML document description, and because it is an
extremely complicated construct. If you are lucky, TtH will not mess
up your tabbing environment too much, but it makes no attempt to
interpret it properly.) Considerable effort has been expended to
translate the tabular environment, including interpreting the
alignment argument of the environment, into as near an equivalent in
HTML as reasonably achievable<a href="#tthFtNtAAG" name="tthFrefAAG"><sup>6</sup></a>. However, the limitations of HTML tables impose
the following limitations on the translation.

      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc7.1">
7.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tabular</H3>

<UL>
<p>

<li> HTML tables have either all cells bordered with rules or
none. TtH therefore decides whether to use a bordered table by
examining the first character of the alignment argument. If is it
<tt>|</tt>, then the table is bordered, otherwise not.

<p>

<li> HTML tables are not capable of simultaneously aligning part of a
cell's contents to the right and part to the left, which is
automatically done by LaTeX on some occasions when @-strings are used.
For example if the alignment argument is <tt>|l@{~units}|r|</tt>, LaTeX
will align ``units'' to the right of the first cell. TtH can't. In
some unbordered cases TtH will try for the same effect by putting the
closing @-string in the following cell. This won't always give a good
result.

<p>

<li> For the <tt>p{width}</tt> alignment, which denotes that a cell is
a parbox of specified width, TtH uses a fixed width of 200 pixels because
it does not understand TeX dimension commands.

<p>

<li> TtH currently can't interpret multiple alignment codes expressed
in the form for example <tt>*{n}{c|}</tt>, meaning <tt>n</tt> repetitions of
<tt>c|</tt>.

<p>

<li> @-strings are not permitted in the alignment argument to
<tt>\multicolumn</tt>, but they are in the main tabular alignment
argument.
</UL>
<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc7.2">
7.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Halign</H3>

<p>

<UL>
<li> TtH decides whether to use a bordered table in Plain TeX
 by examining the entire halign template (i.e.&nbsp;the material up to the
first <tt>\cr</tt> of the halign). If it contains the command
<tt>\vrule</tt> TtH makes the table bordered, otherwise not.

<p>

<li> TtH decides on the alignment of the cell contents by looking for
<tt>\hfill</tt> or <tt>\hss</tt> commands in the cell template. The
default is to left-align the cell. If one of these spacing commands is present
in the template prior to the <tt>#</tt> for this cell, then the cell
will be right-aligned unless such a command also appears after the
<tt>#</tt>, in which case the cell is centered. Again HTML is not capable of
applying different alignments to different parts of a cell. So results may
sometimes be different from TeX. However, if most of this paragraph
sounds totally obscure to you, don't worry; TtH will probably do the
right thing.

<p>

<li> The <tt>\multispan</tt> command is supported, giving a centered
multicolumn cell, and <tt>\omit</tt> is treated as <tt>\multispan1</tt>.

<a NAME="definitions+delimited81">
</a>Delimited parameter definitions are fully supported. Moreover, in TtH
versions 2.0 on, they should be 100% compatible with TeX, even in
respect of space compression around commands. However, macros in some
style files are written in such a way that the recognition of the
delimited parameter depends on other TeX behaviour (e.g. dimensions)
that are not supported by TtH. In such cases it is all too possible
for the delimited parameter <em>not</em> to be matched, resulting in a
runaway argument situation.  Thus, delimited parameter macros are
especially dangerous when using TtH, or indeed any process other than
TeX itself. (And they are never exactly ``safe TeX''). The recognition
of these definitions can be disabled using the -d switch, in which
case the definitions are simply discarded.

<p>
<a NAME="if81">
</a>Conditionals such as <tt>\if</tt>, <tt>\ifnum</tt> and so on are
supported, as listed above (<A href="#ifs">1.1.2</A>). In TtH they have one
syntax limitation. Further `if' commands are not permitted in, or as part of
a command expanded in, the tokens, characters, or numbers being
tested. Thus, an example of truly perverse usage such as<br>
<tt>\ifnum 1=\if ab 1\else 2\fi  True \else False \fi</tt><br>will likely
break. Nested `if' constructs <em>are</em> permitted in the conditional
text, however, so<br>
<tt>\ifnum 1=1 True\if ab -true\else -false\fi \else False \fi</tt><br>is fine.
Because TtH does not internally resemble TeX, whereas the result of
conditionals such as <tt>\if</tt> and <tt>\ifx</tt> may depend on internal
representations, there cannot be 100% compatibility of such tests at
the lowest level. Still, tests on externally defined commands ought
generally to give correct results. When authoring documents in TeX one
is generally well advised to avoid conditionals.

Although TtH supports a remarkably complete subset of L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X, it does
not support all of the complicated primitive details of
T<sub>E</sub>X, partly because that would be unnecessary.<a NAME="charcodes81">
</a> 
For example, practically any T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;that redefines <b>category codes</b>
(other than @ which TtH treats universally as a letter) will break because
TtH knows nothing about the concept of category codes. (If you don't
know much either, about this unfortunate aspect of T<sub>E</sub>X, join the vast
majority of T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;users!)  A related example is that TtH expects <b>
only letters or @ in user-defined command names</b>, not punctuation
characters etc.

</a>Although macro definitions are supported by TtH, if they contain
dimensions or other unsupported constructs, it is often better to
leave the definitions in a file on the texinputs path. The file will
then not be found by TtH. That provides a mechanism to include the
definitions when ``TeX''ing the file, but not when ``TtH''ing it. If
the definition is required in TtH, the full path should be specified

\dothis{one}{two}{three}, are treated by discarding
all the following <i>adjacent</i> brace groups. A space between the close and
open braces will terminate the discarded arguments and cause the
following brace group(s) to be scanned as if just the text. This
makes it possible to use formatting to make TeX code come out right in
both TeX and HTML. For example if TtH encounters a command written
``\boxthis{width} {boxed material}'' which might be
designed in TeX to provide a width to a defined command, written with
a space after the first argument, it will ignore the width and scan
the boxed material into the text.

major packages that redefine standard TeX commands. For example amsTeX
redefines footnote to have just one argument, which will cause
problems. This particular example is potentially a problem with LaTeX
too, which also redefines footnote. TtH handles this by keeping track
of whether the file is LaTeX or TeX; therefore you should not mix the
two dialects in a single file even though there is no need to tell TtH
explicitly which type the file is. (Besides, a mixed file will play
havoc with TeX itself.)

designed with the capabilities of TtH in mind, may readily be
substituted when using TtH for translation. One way to do this is to
leave the original macro or style file on the texinputs path so it is
not accessed by TtH, but to prefix the alternative package for
TtH. This can be done without alteration of the original T<sub>E</sub>X files by
using, for example, the following command line:

9.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;MacIntosh browser font problems</H3>
<a NAME="Mac browsers91">
</a>
The characters with codes higher than 127 in the Mac fonts are in a
different order from the standard ISO-8859-1 (sometimes called ISO
Latin-1).  If Netscape or IE on Macs have their document encoding set
to the standard, then in versions 3 onwards they are programmed to
access the glyph where they think the corresponding accented Latin
character will be in the Mac font. This is fine if one really wants an
accented Latin character. However, for mathematics, using the symbol
font (which is ordered the SAME on the Mac as on other platforms) the
result is that one gets the wrong symbol glyph. This is a particular
problem with large delimiters. The fix is that the Mac browser must be
set to use the Options/Document-encoding ``MacRoman". This tells the
browser not to do the permutation to access the accented Latin
characters in the Mac places; hence, for eight-bit characters, it
accesses the symbol font correctly. This would break the Latin
accented characters except for the fact that (most current versions
of) the browsers still access characters in the Mac order if they are
specified numerically using the HTML syntax ``&amp;#???;". So TtH
documents will in most cases display both accented characters and
symbols correctly on Macs if the document-encoding is set to MacRoman.

<p>
In addition, NS4.0 has under Edit Preferences Fonts a choice between
``use document fonts'' and ``use my fonts overriding document''. You
need to set ``use document fonts''. This necessity is obvious if you
think about it. You can make any document into garbage by specifying
your own font (e.g. Greek or Cyrilic) that happens not to be what the
document is written in. The same is true for the symbols of
mathematics. The reader must permit the document to specify the font.
Browsers should always set ``use document fonts'' as the default.

<p>
In summary, you might want to tell people viewing your documents to
set their browsers to View Encoding MacRoman, and Edit Preferences
Fonts Use-document-fonts (NS 4.0).

Netscape Composer (in Netscape Communicator 4.0 on) is
too clever for its own good. If you run an HTML document produced by TtH
through Netscape Composer, all sorts of internal translations are
performed that are detrimental to its eventual display. For example,
if you subsequently save the document with the usual encoding set
(Western), the eightbit codes that work with Macs are replaced with
HTML4.0 entities such as [&amp;]ograve; or [&amp;]pound;. This effectively
breaks the document for viewing on Macs because it undoes everything
just explained. Even if you use User-Defined encoding, which prevents
this particular substitution, Composer will rearrange the document in
various ways that it thinks are better, but that make the display of
the document worse. The moral is, don't run TtH documents through
Netscape Composer.<a NAME="publish+through composer disallowed92">

<a NAME="vertical alignment96">
</a>Under Wind*ws, both Netscape (3.0) and Internet Expl*rer (3.02)
incorrectly size or space vertically the symbol glyphs so that small
gaps appear between the parts of large symbols and delimiters. This
occurs only at certain font sizes (different between the two
browsers!) but causes a slightly annoying degradation of the
appearance.

<p>
Both Netscape and IE fail (although somewhat differently) to carry
font changing commands from cell to cell of HTML3.2 tables. In
rendering equations (using tables) TtH circumvents this bug at the
cost of significant extra effort and slightly verbose HTML.  However,
for tables generated by <tt>\halign</tt> or <tt>\begin{tabular}</tt> TtH
takes no special steps to avoid this bug. Therefore you cannot, for
example, increase the font size of an entire table by enclosing it in
<tt>{\large ... }</tt> and indeed the table will revert to the default
size even if it is inside a different sized section of text. Moreover,
a change of font face in a cell, for example by <tt>\it</tt> will not
carry over to the next cell.  A document containing this problem will
not pass some HTML validations.  It is prevented if every cell of a
TeX table is enclosed in braces and the required style applied
separately to every cell - a serious annoyance.

IE can become confused about its vertical alignment in tables, with
the result that symbols float above or below the horizontal line in
built-up equations. This sometimes fixes itself if you simply refresh

9.7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal HTML validation</H3>
<a NAME="title+HTML construction97">
</a>
TtH takes as its standard HTML that can be rendered by Netscape and IE
browsers versions 3 and higher (with the caveats above). Documents
without mathematical symbols, translated by TtH, conform to the HTML3.2
standard. Since the font tag needed for symbols is not part of the
HTML3.2 standard, any such symbols compromise that formal
standard. Therefore the formal standard that TtH-translated documents
follow is strictly HTML4.0 Transitional. However, TtH does not
formally validate its documents, and can be made to violate the
standard by some TeX usage. 

<p>
One reason for violation
arises because HTML4.0 <i>requires</i> a
<tt>&lt;title&#62;...&lt;/title&#62;</tt> for every document.
A title is constructed from LaTeX files that contain the <tt>\title{...}</tt>
command, in which case HTML conformance is ensured by putting the
<tt>\title</tt> command before any text (i.e.&nbsp;in the preamble, where it
belongs).  If the <tt>\title</tt> command is not desired in the TeX
file, for example because it is a plain TeX document,
a title can be provided by the author for the HTML document by putting
a line like this at the top of the TeX file.

<pre>
%%tth:\begin{html}&lt;title&#62;Put the title here&lt;/title&#62;\end{html}
</pre>
This line will be ignored by TeX. Actually, any raw HTML output at the
start of the file is assumed by TtH to indicate that the author has
explicitly output a title. If no title indication of any of the above
types is present, TtH attempts to construct a title from the first few
plain words in the document, in much the way that the first line can
become the title of a hymn.  If commands like
<tt>\beginsection</tt> that output material to the HTML file occur
before the title has been constructed, the HTML title command will be
out of order and the formal standard will be violated. (See the FAQ
[<A href="#headbody">B</A>] for discussion of <tt>&lt;head&#62;</tt> and <tt>&lt;body&#62;</tt>.)

<p>
In the case where the title construction fails, or if some other TeX
usage causes a violation of the formal standard, browsers will
still render the output correctly if this manual is followed.

10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Code Critique</H2>

<p>
<a NAME="bugs100">
</a>Known limitations are significant but mostly covered above.  I would
be interested to hear about bugs but only if reports are accompanied
by the brief section of TeX code that causes the problem. Ungraceful
failures to parse straightforward TeX code are of most
interest. Aesthetic critiques (with TeX code) will be considered for
future improvements. Failures on complicated macros are to be
expected.  It is now very difficult to crash TtH by exceeding array
bounds. I would like to hear about it if you succeed, especially
if the code gives no error with TeX.  I would be glad to receive
LaTeX2e files (emailed to hutch@psfc.mit.edu) that illustrate LaTeX
bugs. But please don't send LaTeX2.09 files or files that do not
conform to the latest (1994) LaTeX users' guide. And please check in
the FAQ (<A href="#FAQ">B</A>) first.

B</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions</H2>
<A NAME="FAQ">
</A>

<p>
<b>Why won't TtH run under DOS? Something about DPMI.</b><br>
It will, but the distributed DOS executable needs DPMI memory
extension support to run. Plain old DOS doesn't have that unless you
specifically load it.  All Wind*ws versions from 3.1 on support it at
the DOS prompt.

<p>
<b>Why won't TtH run from Program Manager in Wind*ws?</b><br>
You need a command line. Call up the DOS prompt.

<p>
<b>TtH does not recognize tableofcontents, backward
references, listoffigures, ...</b><br>
Yes it does, see section <A href="#Latexfiles">6.1</A>, and use the <tt>-L</tt> switch.

<p>
<b>TtH does not insert my picture environments.</b><br>
If picture environment pictures are to be included, conversion to a gif file
is needed. See <A href="#pict">6.4</A>.

<p>
<b>TtH messes up my tabbing environment.</b><br>
Tabbing is not currently supported. It is alien to the HTML document
mark-up approach. See section <A href="#tabhal">7</A>.

<p>
<b>How do I make TtH border my tabular table?</b><br>
TtH looks in the format string argument of the begin{tabular}
environment and if it begins with a <tt>|</tt> (vertical bar) then the HTML
table is bordered.

<p>
<b>TtH inserts the title and author even without the
maketitle command</b><br>
True, TtH inserts them when you define them. This gives you a chance
to fine-tune the presentation if you wish.

<p>
<a NAME="switch+-LB0">
</a><a NAME="frac command+see switch -LB0">
</a><b>Why doesn't <tt>\</tt>frac work in equations?</b><br>
It does, but only in LaTeX documents because <tt>\frac</tt> is not a
plain TeX command. The document you are presenting to TtH doubtless
has no <tt>\documentclass</tt> command and other LaTeX blurb at the top.
If you insist on having LaTeX commands available in such a document,
you can use the <tt>-L</tt> switch. But note that other changes in
interpretation (e.g. in footnotes) are implied by using this switch to
tell TtH that this is a LaTeX file.

<p>
<b>What is this strange result using <tt>\</tt>dot
<tt>\</tt>hat <tt>\</tt>tilde <tt>\</tt>frac
<tt>\</tt>vec ... in in-line equations?</b><br>
Neither over and under accents nor built-up constructs such as
fractions can be rendered in-line (i.e. in a textstyle equation
produced by $ ... $) in HTML. Therefore, TtH outputs something that is
not elegant but reasonably indicates the original
intention. Additional brackets are inserted to ensure that fractions
are unambiguous. TtH <em>will</em> render all these built-up constructs
correctly in a <em>display</em> equation. See also <A href="#inline">5.2</A> for an option.

<p>
<b>Why does the large square root sign look so ugly?</b><br>
There are some things that browser symbol fonts can't do well.

<p>
<b>Why does a dagger sign come out strange?</b><br>
Browsers don't generally have a dagger sign in their fonts. TtH uses a
kludge.

<p>
<a NAME="TtH-only codeB0">
</a><a NAME="iftthB0">
</a><b>How do I insert code that is used only by TtH, not TeX?</b><br>
Use <tt>%%tth:</tt> followed by the material you wish to pass to TtH.
TeX omits this line as a comment. Alternatively, insert <tt>\newif\iftth</tt>
at the top of your document, then use a conditional:
<tt>\iftth TtH material \fi</tt>. TtH recognizes <tt>\iftth</tt> as a
special `if' that is always true, whereas to TeX it is simply a
new `if', which by default is false when defined.

<p>
<a NAME="HTML+tagsB0">
</a><b>How do I insert HTML tags into my file without TeX knowing?</b><br>
Use <tt>%%tth:</tt> then on this line put 
<tt>\begin{html} tags \end{html}</tt>. Do not try to continue this
html onto a second line with a second <tt>%%tth:</tt> before the
<tt>\end{HTML}</tt> because the html environment will output the
<tt>%%tth:</tt>, which it probably not what you want. Another way to
pass codes directly to the output is the <tt>\special{html: ... }</tt>
command. Do
<em>not</em> use <tt>\begin{verbatim}</tt> to pass HTML tags. It will
convert the greater than and less than signs to make them appear in
the display and not be interpreted as tags.

<p>
<a NAME="TeX-only codeB0">
</a><b>How do I insert code that is used only by TeX, not TtH?</b><br>
Insert the definition <tt>\def\tthdump#1{#1}</tt> at the top of the file and
then use <tt>\tthdump{TeX material}</tt> to pass stuff only to TeX.
Thus, for example, the following will output alternate versions from
TeX and TtH.
<pre>
\def\tthdump#1{#1}
%%tth:\begin{html}&lt;H1&#62;The HTML Header&lt;/H1&#62;\end{html}
\tthdump{\beginsection{The TeX Header}\par}
</pre>
Alternatively, use (after <tt>\newif\iftth</tt>) the conditional construction.

<pre>\iftth \beginsection{The TtH Header}\par \else \beginsection{The TeX Header}\fi
</pre>
The `else' clause may also be used with a blank first clause, of
course: <tt>\iftth\else ... \fi</tt>.

<p>
<b>How do I include the style file ...sty for the TeX paper I prepared for... journal?</b><br>
If you are wise, you probably don't. TtH often can't handle
 complicated journal formats for [La]TeX without modification, because
 they frequently use dimensions, boxes, category code modification or
 other unsupported constructs. Instead, look at your TeX file, or the
 TtH messages telling you which commands are unknown. Decide which of
 the journal's specific commands or environments you used or
 need. Write a little style file that defines them to do something
 simple and sensible, or translates them into standard LaTeX
 commands. Or ask the journal to provide such a style file! If you are
 a journal publisher, distribute your simplified style file to your
 authors.

<p>
<b>Why does TtH not recognize my ends of lines properly?</b><br>
If you transfer a file from one operating system to another as a
binary file, the line-end codes are likely to be messed up. They use
different codes on Un*x, DOS, and Mac. Usually TeX is not bothered by
this. TtH is somewhat more sensitive. Use ASCII transfer.

<p>
<b>TtH does not recognize evironment ... even though it
claims to.</b><br>
Probably you left a spurious space, e.g. <tt>\begin {enumerate}</tt>
between the <tt>\begin</tt> and the following brace. TtH won't generally
accept that, even though LaTeX does. It is bad style.

<p>
<a NAME="longtableB0">
</a><b>Why does not TtH recognize the longtable environment?</b><br>
It is not part of the standard LaTeX2e.

<p>
<a NAME="extensions to LaTeXB0">
</a><a NAME="LaTeX extension packagesB0">
</a><b>Why does TtH not recognize ... command from ... style
package?</b><br>
Let's be perfectly clear here. TtH does not currently recognize 
<tt>\usepackage</tt> and, with the exception of commands explicitly
mentioned in this manual, does not support <em>any</em> of the zillions
of extensions to LaTeX that exist, even if they are part of the
``standard distribution''.

<p>
<b>The file I ``published'' using Netscape Composer looks
messed up when viewed on a Mac.</b><br>
Don't use Composer on TtH documents. See section <A href="#nscomp">9.2</A>.

<p>
<b>In bordered tables I want an empty cell to look
empty. How do I make TtH do that?</b><br>
HTML tables by default ``fill in'' an empty cell, so that it gives the
visual impression of being absent. This is sometimes useful, so TtH
does not prevent it. If you want it to look like an empty cell, put a
non-break space in it by <tt>&amp;~&amp;</tt> in the TeX.

<p>
<b>Why does TtH mess up my <tt>\</tt>fbox, minipage, etc?</b><br>
The whole concept of a ``box'' is inappropriate for HTML. TtH tries to
take reasonable action on encountering one. But in some cases,
especially in equations, it can't cope.

<p>
<b>Why does TtH complain about my skip, space, ... command?</b><br>
Dimensions are inappropriate for HTML. TtH tries to remove all
dimension, space, and glue commands with the exception of bigskip,
medskip and smallskip. Usually it is successful. If so, you need do
nothing. In some rare cases, you might see some irrelevant left-over
characters from the dimension command that have to be removed by hand.

<p>
<a NAME="calligraphicB0">
</a><b>How do I get caligraphic fonts, {<tt>\</tt>cal E}, AMS
fonts,  etc?</b><br>
You can't because browsers don't have access to them. TtH can only
support fonts that are available on the browsers that eventually visit
the page. By default TtH tells the browser to render caligraphic as
italic helvetica font. You may, if you wish, define <tt>\cal</tt> to be
something different, such as <tt>%%tth:\def\cal{\it\color{red}}</tt>.

<p>
<b>Why does TtH turn double-quotes into an accent instead of quotes?</b><br>
In basic TeX the double quotes character <tt>"</tt> is not defined, and
hence may do anything that the local installation feels like. Double
quotes must be inserted by using two quote '' or back-quote ``
characters.  In German TeX implementations, the double-quotes
character is used to provide the umlaut over accent and for some other
special needs. TtH supports these German uses in some appropriate
contexts. English speakers should adopt proper TeX quote usage.

<p>
<b>How do I include into a macro I am defining a # sign
for an HTML reference?</b><br>
When you do <tt>\special{html:&lt;a href="#reference"&#62;}</tt> 
TtH just puts the html tag in the output verbatim. TeX does essentially the
same for its dvi file and the dvi processor later may or may not complain
about not understanding it; but generally it is ignored. However if you try
to define a macro like
<tt>\def\localhref{\special{html:&lt;a href="#reference"&#62;}}</tt> then TeX
will complain as follows:
<pre>
! Illegal parameter number in definition of \localref.
&lt;to be read again&#62; 
                   r
l.3 \def\localref{\special{html:&lt;a href="#r
                                            eference"&#62;}}
?</pre> This problem is caused by TeX's syntax analysis of
the contents of the definition. One solution is to <i>hide</i> the
definition from TeX using <tt>%%tth:</tt>. An alternative definition
that avoids this problem must also be included for TeX's benefit, for
example thus:
<pre>
\def\tthdump#1{#1}
\tthdump{\edef\localref{[a hyperreference]}}
%%tth:\def\localhref{\special{html:&lt;a href="#reference"&#62;}}
</pre>
Alternatively, use <tt>\#</tt> in place of <tt>#</tt> in the hypertex
reference. TtH specifically recognizes this as a literal and does
appropriate translation. For example

<pre>
\def\localhref#1#2{\special{html:&lt;a href="\##1"&#62;}#2\special{html:&lt;/a&#62;}}
</pre>
will use its first parameter as a local anchor reference, preceded by <tt>#</tt>,
and its second as the text of the anchor.

<p>
<b>How do I construct a macro to take as a single
argument a URL, which may contain special TeX characters like</b> 
<tt>_ ~ @ &amp;</tt> 
<b>etc, that makes TtH construct a hyperreference but TeX just enter it in the
text?</b><br>Use the built-in command <tt>\url{...}</tt>. This behaves in
essentially the same way as the command defined in LaTeX's
url.sty. The reference will appear verbatim in the text (in teletype
font).

<p>
<b>TtH seems not to work on WinNT when converting
included PostScript files, even though my ps2gif program works fine
from the command line. What is the problem?</b><br>
The problem is not TtH. It appears to be an operating system
problem. The batch program ps2gif is breaking for some strange reason
when called from TtH. See footnote 4.

<p>
<A NAME="headbody">
</A><a NAME="headB0">
</a><a NAME="bodyB0">
</a><b>Why doesn't TtH automatically generate</b> <tt>&lt;head&#62;</tt>
and <tt>&lt;body&#62;</tt> <b>HTML tags?</b><br>
 First, the <tt>&lt;head&#62;</tt> and
<tt>&lt;body&#62;</tt> are <em>optional</em> in the HTML specification. There is
no need for TtH to generate them to statisfy the standard. Second, TeX
and LaTeX files do not have a corresponding structural division into
separate head and body sections. It might seem as if LaTeX does, with
<tt>\begin{document}</tt>  being the divider, but there are many cases
where this mapping is incorrect. For example title may not be defined
until after <tt>\begin{document}</tt>, corresponding to the HTML body
section, whereas it must be in the head section. Finally, if TtH
automatically entered <tt>&lt;head&#62;</tt> and <tt>&lt;body&#62;</tt> tags, then the
thoughtful author would not be able to enter them where they ought to
be by using, for example:<br>
<tt>%%tth: \begin{html} &lt;head&#62; \end{html}</tt><br>
Therefore, the choice <em>not</em> to produce these tags automatically
is a deliberate one based on a careful consideration of the advantages
and disadvantages. An author can always adjust their TeX code to
include them, if they wish to be pedantic about the division.

<p><a name="tthFtNtAAB"></a><a href="#tthFrefAAB"><sup>1</sup></a> The problem with <tt>\rm</tt> in text is
that HTML has no <tt> &lt; rm &gt; </tt> tag, and relies on cancelling all previous
(e.g.)  <tt> &lt; i &gt; </tt> or <tt> &lt; b &gt; </tt> tags. TtHgold has a style switch -y that
uses Cascading Style Sheets to solve this problem. However not all
older browsers support CSS. The best solution is to avoid <tt>\rm</tt> by
using proper grouping of non-roman text. (In equations <tt>\rm</tt>
is essential, but TtH has a work-around in equations.)
<p><a name="tthFtNtAAC"></a><a href="#tthFrefAAC"><sup>2</sup></a> Conditionals <tt>\</tt><tt>if</tt>
 and <tt>\</tt><tt>ifx</tt> are not 100% TeX compatible for cases
where they refer to internal TeX commands because TtH internals are
not identical. Catcodes are also unknown to TtH.
<p><a name="tthFtNtAAD"></a><a href="#tthFrefAAD"><sup>3</sup></a> See appendix for TeX macros supporting these commands
<p><a name="tthFtNtAAE"></a><a href="#tthFrefAAE"><sup>4</sup></a> Using the ``span'' construct, and possibly
cascading style sheets, it ought to be possible to insert tables in
line. However NS4.5 and earlier do not behave rationally in this
context. Let's hope this browser problem is soon fixed.
<p><a name="tthFtNtAAF"></a><a href="#tthFrefAAF"><sup>5</sup></a> May 1999 reports indicate that there is a
batch program in circulation bearing the comment ``:#batchified by
cschenk@snafu.de'' that tries to implement the functionality of ps2gif
and gives errors on WinNT when called by TtH but not when called from
the command line. This problem appears to be related to memory
management or other some operating system inadequacy. It would do
everyone running on Wind*ws systems a favor if someone could figure
out what the problem is and let me know at
<a href="tth@hutchinson.belmont.ma.us">tth@hutchinson.belmont.ma.us</a>.
Meanwhile, it is reported that removing the pnmmargin command from the
ps2gif batch file enables it to run. Remember, ps2gif is the user's
responsibility.
<p><a name="tthFtNtAAG"></a><a href="#tthFrefAAG"><sup>6</sup></a> The alignment argument of the
math array environment was ignored in TtH versions earlier than 2.20
but is now honored.
