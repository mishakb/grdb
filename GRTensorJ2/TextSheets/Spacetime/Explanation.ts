#Explanation of spacetimes
#=========================
#Spacetimes can be represented in a number of ways. These include:
#
#Coordinates (i.e. the metric tensor)
#NP-Newman-Penrose (contravariant) null tetrad 
#NPC-Newman-Penrose (covariant) null tetrad 
#basis (not null, constant and variable inner product) 
#
#The current selection of input spacetimes is for demonstration only.
#A database of spacetimes is under construction.
