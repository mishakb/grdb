#NOTE-1: The calculations are executed while you wait.
#Stored information consists only of the input spacetime (with constraints).
#
#NOTE-2: The current selection of input spacetimes is for demonstration only.
#A database of spacetimes is under construction.
#
#NOTE-3: This is still a development version with limited help on line.
