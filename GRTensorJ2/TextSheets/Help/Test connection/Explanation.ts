#Explanation of connection test
#==============================
#The apparent performance of GRTensorJ can be affected by connection problems.
#This test returns the CPU time for a standard calculation (Kretschmann for Kerr)
#and should reflect the actual time you waited (typically a few seconds). If you
#had to wait significantly longer, try again latter. The test must be run from a
#fresh connection to GRTensorJ in order to reflect an accurate CPU time.
