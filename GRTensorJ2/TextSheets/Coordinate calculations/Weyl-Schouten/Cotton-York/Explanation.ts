#Explanation of the Cotton-York tensor
#=====================================
#
#The Cotton-York tensor is a two-index symmetric,divergence and trace-free tensor  
#which in three dimensions is zero if and only if the space is conformally flat. 
#
#A definition, valid in three dimensions, is given by
#CY{^a ^b}:=2*LevC{^a^c^d}*(R{^b c ;d}-kdelta{^b c}*R{^f f ;d}/4)
#
#The Cotton-York and Weyl-Schouten tensors are related by
#
#CY{^a^b}=e{^a^c^d}g{^b^e}WS{ecd}
