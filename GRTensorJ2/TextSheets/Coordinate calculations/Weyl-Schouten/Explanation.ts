#Explanation of the Weyl-Schouten tensor
#=======================================
#The Weyl-Schouten tensor is a three index tensor which in three dimensions is zero 
#if and only if the space is conformally flat. 
#
#It is defined by
#WS{a [ b c ] }:=R{a b ; c}-R{a c ; b}-(g{a b}*R{^e e; c}-g{a c}*R{^f f ; b})/4
