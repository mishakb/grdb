#Explanation
#===========
#The Weyl Scalars should be simplified as much as possible before the Petrov 
#type is calculated. Petrov Report explains why the classification was given.
#It can happen that further simplification is possible and so, as a general rule,
#the Pertrov Report should be examined.
