#Explanation of nptetrad:
#========================
#nptetrad is under development.
#The process will attempt to automatically generate a Newman-Penrose tetrad.
#The process can fail and so you should check that the basis inner product is
#[0, 1,  0,  0]
#[1, 0,  0,  0]
#[0, 0,  0, -1]
#[0, 0, -1,  0]
#The process can also generate a correct tetrad which is not very useful, especially
#if roots are involved. A simple example is the standard Robertson-Walker spacetime. 
#As a general rule, it is always preferable to use a pre-defined tetrad.
