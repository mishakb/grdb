#Explanation of input field calculations
#=======================================
#These calculations, except for KillingCoord, require an input 4-vector field u{^a}.
#
#You must supply this field via Custom. Choose "Create a new single definition object"
#
#The protocol is `u{^a}:=[u^1,u^2,u^3,u^4]` where u^1 etc. are the components.
